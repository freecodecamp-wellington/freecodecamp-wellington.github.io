Join and help shape the first edition of the first freeCodeCamp hack night! 👩‍💻

After hosting five lunch & code events this will be the first evening event.
Having 3 hours will allow for activities that require a little more time. This
is a perfect event to learn and collaborate by pair programming, picking someones
brain on how to solve issues in your private projects or working on the freeCodeCamp
curriculum.

Already working on, or starting an open source project?  👋 This is the perfect setting to find collaborators.

Want to start contributing to open source? ❤️ Otto is a freeCodeCamp contributor and leads
a project involving all the good things: Lambdas in AWS, testing with Jest, Node 8.10
and GraphQL. He'll be happy to get anyone interested started in collaborating on
Open Source in general or one of the freeCodeCamp projects.
