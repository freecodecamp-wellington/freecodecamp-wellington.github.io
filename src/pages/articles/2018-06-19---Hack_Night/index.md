The second freeCodeCamp hack night!

Having 3 hours will allow for activities that require a little more time. This is a perfect event to learn and collaborate by pair programming, picking someones brain on how to solve issues in your private projects or working on the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

Already working on, or starting an open source project? üëã This is the perfect setting to find collaborators.

Want to start contributing to open source? ‚ù§Ô∏è Otto is a freeCodeCamp contributor and leads a project involving all the good things: Lambdas in AWS, testing with Jest, Node 8.10 and GraphQL. He‚Äôll be happy to get anyone interested started in collaborating on Open Source in general or one of the freeCodeCamp projects.
