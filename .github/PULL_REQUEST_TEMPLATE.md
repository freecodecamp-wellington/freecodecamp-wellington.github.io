# Contributing to FreeCodeCamp Wellington

If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request on a branch other than the master branch.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests eventually need to resolve to a single commit. The commit log should be easy to read as a change log. We use the following form to accomplish that.
* First line is a <=72 character description in present tense, explaining what this does.
  * Ex. "Fixes regression on encoding and headers" > "Fixed encoding bug", which forces the reader to look at code to understand impact.
* Do not include issue links in the first line as that makes pull requests look weird.
  * Ex. "Addresses #345" becomes a pull request title: "Addresses #345 #346"
* After the first line, use markdown to concisely summarize the implementation.
  * This isn't in leiu of comments, and it assumes the reader isn't intimately familar with code structure.
* If the change closes an issue, note that at the end of the commit description ex. "Fixes #345"
  * GitHub will automatically close changes with this syntax.
