# Contributing/Development 

Feel free to contribute to this project. We welcome your
feedback and want to listen and discuss your ideas and issues.

There are many different ways to help contribute to the FreeCodeCamp Wellington project.

* Helping others by participating in the [FreeCodeCamp Wellington Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/freeCodeCamp-Wellington/)
* Fixing open issues listed in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/freecodecamp-wellington/freecodecamp-wellington.github.io/issues)
* Adding new features to the FreeCodeCamp Wellington codebase

# Guidelines

When submitting a pull request, please make sure to fork the repository and create a
separate branch for your feature or fix for an issue.

All contributions are welcome to be submitted for review for inclusion, but before
they will be accepted, we ask that you follow these simple guidelines:

## Code style

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and
style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. 

## Testing

We kindly ask that all new features and fixes for an issue should include any unit tests.
Even if it is a small improvement, adding a unit test will help to ensure no regressions or the issue is not re-introduced. 
If you need help with writing a test for your feature, please don't be shy and ask!

## Documentation

Up-to-date documentation makes all our lives easier. If you are adding a new feature,
enhancing an existing feature, or fixing an issue, please add or modify the documentation
as needed and include it with your pull request.

## New Features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please raise an issue before sending a
pull request so the feature can be discussed. **We appreciate the effort and want
to avoid a situation where a contribution requires extensive rework on either side,
it sits in the queue for a long time, or cannot be accepted at all.**


*Feel free to post questions about internals, ideas for new features or refactorings,
different strategies, requests for comment/review etc. This is the forum for everyone
who wants to actively contribute to the project itself.*
